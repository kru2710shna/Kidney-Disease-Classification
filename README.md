# Kidney Image Classifier

## Step 1: Automated Python Folder and File Generator

### Overview
This step involves creating an automated script that generates a predefined folder structure and necessary files for the Kidney Image Classifier project. The script also incorporates logging to track the creation of directories and files.

### Features
- **Automated Folder and File Generation**: Automatically creates the required directories and files for the project.
- **Logging**: Logs activities such as directory creation and file creation to provide insight into the script's operations.

### Project Template
A project template is provided in the file named `template.py`. This template serves as a reference for structuring the Kidney Image Classifier project.

### Usage
To use the automated folder and file generator, run the script associated with this step. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create directories and files on your system.

## Conclusion
The automated folder and file generator simplifies the initial setup of the Kidney Image Classifier project, allowing developers to focus on implementation rather than project structure.
