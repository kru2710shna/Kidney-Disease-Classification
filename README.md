# Kidney Image Classifier

# Kidney Tumor

A kidney tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in the kidneys. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Understanding kidney tumors is essential for early diagnosis and effective treatment.

## Types of Kidney Tumors

1. **Benign Tumors**
   - **Angiomyolipoma**: Composed of blood vessels, muscle, and fat; often does not require treatment unless large.
   - **Oncocytoma**: A rare tumor that is typically slow-growing and usually requires no treatment unless symptomatic.

2. **Malignant Tumors**
   - **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**: The most common type of kidney cancer in adults, often diagnosed in advanced stages.
   - **Wilms Tumor**: A type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children, typically occurs in children aged 3 to 4 years.
   - **Transitional Cell Carcinoma**: A cancer that can occur in the kidney and the urinary tract.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of kidney tumors may vary but can include:
- Blood in urine (hematuria)
- Persistent back pain or side pain
- A lump in the abdomen or side
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing kidney tumors typically involves:
- **Imaging Tests**: Ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs to visualize the kidneys.
- **Biopsy**: Taking a small tissue sample to determine whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

## Treatment Options

Treatment depends on the type and stage of the tumor:
- **Surgery**: Often the first line of treatment for malignant tumors; may involve partial or complete removal of the kidney.
- **Radiation Therapy**: May be used for tumors that cannot be surgically removed.
- **Chemotherapy**: Usually employed for advanced cases of kidney cancer.

## Conclusion

Kidney tumors require prompt medical attention for proper diagnosis and treatment. Regular check-ups and imaging can help in early detection, improving the chances of successful treatment.

## Step 1: Automated Python Folder and File Generator

### Overview
This step involves creating an automated script that generates a predefined folder structure and necessary files for the Kidney Image Classifier project. The script also incorporates logging to track the creation of directories and files.

### Features
- **Automated Folder and File Generation**: Automatically creates the required directories and files for the project.
- **Logging**: Logs activities such as directory creation and file creation to provide insight into the script's operations.

### Project Template
A project template is provided in the file named `template.py`. This template serves as a reference for structuring the Kidney Image Classifier project.

### Usage
To use the automated folder and file generator, run the script associated with this step. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create directories and files on your system.

## Step 2: Tech Stack

The following libraries and frameworks are utilized in the Kidney Image Classifier project:

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: For managing data and model versions.
- **MLflow**: For tracking experiments and managing machine learning workflows.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and data exploration.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Python-box**: For nested dictionary management.
- **PyYAML**: For YAML file parsing and writing.
- **TQDM**: For progress bar displays in loops.
- **Ensure**: For type-checking and validation.
- **Joblib**: For lightweight pipelining in Python.
- **Types-PyYAML**: For type annotations for PyYAML.
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing and technical computing.
- **Flask**: For creating a web application.
- **Flask-CORS**: For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Flask.
- **Gdown**: For downloading files from Google Drive.
- **-e .**: For installing the package in editable mode.
